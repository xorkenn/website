  <h1>How good is IPv6 only Internet?</h1>
  <p><small>Posted 2020-06-13</small></p>
  <p>Tl;dr: Not that good.</p>
  <p>Earlier this week I got IPv6 enabled on my home Internet connection, so right now I'm dual-stacked running both IPv4 and IPv6 internally and externally. I haven't noticed any issues and I got everything running by just enabling DHCPv6 through the mobile app I use to manage my <a href="https://amplifi.com/amplifi-hd">Amplifi HD</a> device.</p>
  <p>Just for fun I decided to disable the IPv4 stack on my Windows 10 workstation and see what sites and services I use would still be usable over a IPv6 only connection. It's just a fun little experiment and there's lots of things I didn't take into account. For instance I'm not sure if DNS is going over IPv6 or IPv6 at the moment but this is something I will look into in the future. It would also be interesting to compare download speeds, traceroutes and latency (to name a few) between IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
  <p>I plan on doing this test every now and then to see if anything has changed, and also add more items to the list as I can think of them.</p>
  <p>I am also aware of the fact that this site is not available via IPv6. Right now I'm using Github Pages for hosting and that service don't support IPv6. Once I get around to setting up a VPS this will change.</p>
